First thing: only the normal ocean layer brushes were made to mimic vanilla terrain. All the "deep" versions were designed to add gameplay mechanics to the MinecraftEarthMap, of which this pack was primarily made for.

Switching the terrain used by the final layers should be simple, although I think you'll enjoy using the "deep" versions as they add fun things like packed ice, magma, obsidian, prismarine, and sea lanterns.

Since there's so many ocean biomes, and therefore so many ocean layer brushes, here's the list of terrain settings I used.

Terrain ground cover blob scale is 500% for all terrains

warm
 - sand (10/100), dirt (1/50), clay (1/50), gravel (1/25)
 - kelp (5%)
 - seagrass (25%)
 - sea pickles (1%)
 - corals (60% at 1 per 250 blocks at 50%)

lukewarm
 - sand (5/100), gravel (2/75), dirt (1/50), clay (1/50)
 - kelp (2%)
 - sea pickles (0.25%)
 - seagrass (20%)

ocean (neither hot or cold)
 - sand (5/100), gravel (5/100), dirt (1/50), clay (1/50)
 - seagrass (15%)

cold
 - gravel (7/100), sand (1/75), dirt (1/50), clay (1/50)
 - seagrass (10%)

frozen
 - gravel (4/100), dirt (1/50), clay (1/50)


All deep oceans use their own object layers, as specified in each section

deep lukewarm
 - sand (1000/100), gravel (300/30), clay (300/30), bone (100/5), obsidian (1/1), magma (1/1)

 - shipwrecks
 - small ruins (warm sandstone and mossy stonebrick)
   - shipwreck:ruin = 5:1
   - warm:mossy = 3:1
   - 1 object per 16,000
   - 20% factor cover in final
