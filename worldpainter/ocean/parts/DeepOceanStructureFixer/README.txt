wtf is this?

I'm glad you asked.

Honestly, I forgot kinda, but basically this just takes my layer files I made and fixes a mistake in a fast way because
manually going through 500 variants just to sink them a little into the ground sounded less fun than making an entire
java program to do it for me.

So, hope that explains it :)

You should never need to use this, unless you are making your own structure layers, then you might want this.
