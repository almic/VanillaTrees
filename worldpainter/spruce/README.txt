So, "spruce" and "tiaga" are identical biomes except for the shape of the trees which spawn.
More specifically, tiaga biomes have taller and less leafy trees, while spruce are much more leafy.

But to provide a more noticeable difference between the biomes, I've decided that "spruce" would
mean densely packed trees, and "tiaga" would have very sparsely spread trees. To make up for the
sparseness in the mega-variants, tiaga has a much higher number of huge trees than spruce.

When painting snowy layers, and for a more vanilla look, make sure to use the snowy biomes and also
paint frost onto the area. But make sure to disable "Smooth snow" and "Frost under trees" in the
dimension settings under "Other Layers." Since snow only falls straight down, and doesn't spread to
the underside of trees, this provides the most vanilla look in your snowy biomes.

This also looks way better in my opinion.

To work with WorldPainter's "relative percentage," here's the values for each layer:

Mega spruce:
  spruce1: 21% (504 out of 560, or 90%)
  spruce2:  4% (56 out of 560, or 10%)

Mega taiga: (more sparse than spruce)
  spruce1: 3% (36 out of 48, or 75%)
  spruce2: 2% (12 out of 48, or 25%)
