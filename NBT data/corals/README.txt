The corals are special, and ridiculously diverse.

I found 6 unique shapes to corals, which for my own sanity I organized into 6 folders by numbers.

1: corner shaped, 2 short branches
2: flat shape, 2 long branches
3: pitchfork, 3 tall branches
4: nearly symmetrical, 4 tall branches
5: flat, horizontal strips
6: ball shaped

coral1: tube   (blue)
coral2: brain  (pink)
coral3: bubble (purple)
coral4: fire   (red)
coral5: horn   (yellow)

Numbers 6-10 are the corals without any additional coral or seagrass on them.


Due the the incredible shape diversity of the corals, I decided that only 4 variants of each shape were needed.
Already, this brings us to 24 completely different shapes of corals.

Naturally generated corals have growths of smaller coral on them, which I've called "arrangements." I saved the
original arrangement and created a new one using bone meal and some manual guesswork. So, each unique shape has
two unique coral arrangements, bringing the total corals up to 48. I also saved each shape variant, in all 5 of
it's possible colors, without any corals or seagrass on them just in case that's what you want (so another 120).

But obviously, there's 5 different types of coral blocks. Of the original 48 saved coral shapes and arrangements
I found/ created, I just copied what was missing to fill in all the other color. Thankfully NBT files store the
block pallete separate from the block data, so it was easy to do this, but still incredibly tedious.

So, there's exactly 240 unique corals in this pack (plus 120 more without coral plants or seagrass). I couldn't
bring myself to add more, as much as I wish I could have done 4 arrangements per coral, but this would've
resulted in 96 base corals I would have to manually save, and then an additional 384 corals (total of 480) I
would have to manually change the block pallete to fill in the missing colors. This pack has taken me nearly a
week already, the corals are the last thing I'm doing, and I'm not about to do more than double the amount of
work I've already done.


tl;dr: I wanted to make 600 corals, but I could only do 360. Sorry.
