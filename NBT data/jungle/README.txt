36 normal, square shape (5x5), varying height
32 huge, extreme height and wide
18 normal cocoa, exactly like normal but with cocoa (duh)

jungle1: small 1x1 trunks, no vines
jungle2: huge, 2x2 trunks, vines
jungle3: small 1x1, cocoa pods

Normally, jungle biomes generate vines on all trees, but unfortunately growing 1x1 trunk jungle trees spawns no vines, and I couldn't be bothered to spend all that time adding vines.
To make up for this (and to actually provide an important item to your world), I added "jungle3" which are variants of the jungle1 trees but with fully grown cocoa pods on them.
I suggest throwing these together with "jungle1" trees without any percentage changes, because the default ratio of 1:2 trees with pods to trees without is perfectly fine already.
