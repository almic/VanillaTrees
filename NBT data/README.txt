SHEEESH this is a lot of data, over 3MB of NBT objects.

I painfully saved hundreds of NBT objects, and sometimes used scripts to create more varied structures. Overall, this is a repository of over 2.5K UNIQUE NBTs.

If you want them, here they are. These are not important if you only want to use the premade layer brushes (which I **really** suggest you do). If you are a psycho like me, feel free to use this to create all new layer brushes.

The premade layer brushes include a lot of fine tuning to make structures follow their relative probabilities in vanilla Minecraft, with random orientations, and a lot more than I can bear to recall. Just thinking of the tedious things I did makes me shudder, I do not recommend it.

You have been warned.
