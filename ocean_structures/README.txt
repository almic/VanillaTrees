These structures were created using OceanPatcher, a script which condenses the NBT files a bit by removing air blocks and replacing the structure data blocks with seeded loot chests. Minecraft comes with 20 shipwrecks (8 palette variations each) and 48 underwater ruins.

I'd like to mention that the underwater ruin named 'mossy_1' is the one and only ruin that does not include a loot chest in Minecraft. So, I went ahead and added the loot chest exactly where it should have been.

You should really generate these yourself. In fact, now you have to. Because I removed the generated files. Because no one needs to download the same 680 pre-generated structures, which must be at least a few megabytes.
