12 normal, square shape (5x5), varying height
6 beehive, exactly like normal but with a beehive

birch1: normal, 5x5
birch2: beehive tree, 2 bees in the hive

Since beehives spawn on birch trees, and to bring honey to your world (if you want), I manually added a beehive with 2 bees to each "birch2" tree.
I highly suggest spreading these beehives very thin, at least 1 out of 100 birch trees being a "birch2" variant.
