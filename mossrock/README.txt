You're probably confused about why these are here.

Well, mega spruce and mega taiga biomes spawn these special mossy boulders in the landscape.

So... of course I had to include a few of these to "spruce" things up ;)

The numbers are x_y_z sizes. Each rock is unique. I did find some larger formations,
but I determined they were the result of these 9 variants being combined as they sometimes spawn
directly next to each other.

For the optimal experience, sink the rocks slightly into the ground so only the topmost layer is
visible, either sitting above the ground or flush with the ground, both look nice.
